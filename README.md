# Mitochondria Segmentation

Segmentation based approach for mitochondria segmentation from the electron microscopy image dataset.
Dataset can be downloaded from following source: https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-em/

## Conversion of Data Set
* Open the file DataConversion_Prepration.ipynb
* Original Data set is in TIF file resides in actual_data folder
* Run all the commands and data will be populated accordingly for training and testing

## Training Dataset
* Open the DataTraining.ipynb file
* To tweek the parameters change the config.py file 
* Config.py should be change before data set prepration to avoid any errors
* Run all the cells

## Testing Dataset
* Run DataTesting.ipynb
* It will open all the files from testing_data that resides in DATA folder
* It will generate the original, original mask and predicted mask in horizontal stack and store in results folder
* Also provides you the testing IOU score

## Inference.py
* run "python3 inference.py DATA/test_data/images/test-0081.png"
* This will give overlay image of mask
